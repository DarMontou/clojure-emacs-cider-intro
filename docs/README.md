# Introduction

CIDER is an EMACS package that provides a full-featured interactive environment for Clojure and ClojureScript development.

CIDER is an acronym for the **C**lojure(Script) **I**nteractive **D**evelopment **E**nvironment that **R**ocks!

The goal of this presentation is to provide an introduction to CIDER for members of the Austin, TX "EmacsATX" meetup group - https://www.meetup.com/EmacsATX/.

# Audience

This presentation assumes the reader is an active user of GNU Emacs and is comfortable with installation of Emacs packages and editing the Emacs initialization file (init.el).

No prior experience with Clojure is assumed however Java experience is helpful (but not required).
