# Introduction

[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) is an EMACS package that provides a full-featured interactive environment for Clojure and ClojureScript development.

The goal of this presentation is to provide an introduction to CIDER for members of the Austin, TX "EmacsATX" meetup group - https://www.meetup.com/EmacsATX/.

# Audience

This presentation assumes the reader is an active user of GNU Emacs, is comfortable with installation of Emacs packages and with editing the Emacs initialization file (.emacs/init.el). 

If the reader is not an Emacs user, the tutorial [How to Use Emacs, an Excellent Clojure Editor](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/) on the [Brave Clojure](http://www.braveclojure.com/) site is recommended. The tutorial does not presume the user has any prior Emacs experience.

This presentations does not presume any prior experience with Clojure. Prior Java development experience is recommended but not required.

# Disclaimers

I am fairly new to Clojure development and the CIDER Emacs package. Creating this presentation is as much a learning exercise for me much as I hope it is for the reader.

CIDER 0.14 is (was) the version of the most recent stable release when this presentation was created. The reader will likely encounter differences in requirements (e.g. Emacs/Java/Clojure versions), functionality and/or UI when using a version of CIDER other than 0.14.
