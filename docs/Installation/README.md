# Installation

## Emacs

As noted in the [Introduction](../../README.md), this presentation assumes the reader is an active Emacs user and therefore has Emacs installed. You will want to ensure that your version of Emacs meets the minimal version of Cider (see [Prerequisites](../../Prerequisites/README.md)). This presentation uses Emacs 25.1. 

## Java 

Clojure is a JVM-based language and therefore requires an installation of Java. 

If you do not have the minimal version of Java required for CIDER installed ([Prerequisites](../../Prerequisites/README.md)), install the version appropriate for your OS:

* OS X (Oracle Java): [Instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html)
 | [Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 
* Windows (Oracle Java):  [Instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html)
 | [Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

* Linux (OpenJDK): 
 
Ensure that:

 * JAVA_HOME points to the root of the Java install directory
 * The Java 'bin' directory is on your PATH
