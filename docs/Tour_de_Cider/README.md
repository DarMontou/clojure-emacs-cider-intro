# A Quick Tour of Cider

## Setup

Before we get stared, make sure you have:

* Installed CIDER and it's prerequisites (see [Installation](../../Installation/README.md))
    
*  Configured Leiningen to use the CIDER REPL plugin (see [Configuration](../../Configuration/README.md))

* Cloned the [GitHub](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro) repository (see [Presentation Materials](../../Presentation_Materials/README.md))

## Notes

### Emacs Configuration

A minimal base Emacs configuration file ([init.el](../../../code/elisp/init_file/00_base/init.el)) was used for the exercises and screenshots in this chapter. Subsequent chapters will update the base Emacs configuration to enhance the CIDER development experience and provide a link to the updated Emacs config file.

All of the versions of the Emacs config files used in this presentation are located in the GitHub project at:
