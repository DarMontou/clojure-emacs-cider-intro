# Open the Sample Project

The ```code/clj/cider-tour/``` directory in the [GitHub](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro) repo contains the Leiningen Clojure project we will use in this chapter.

In Emacs open the ```project.clj``` file. This is the Leiningen project file that defines, among other things, the project's dependencies:

![project.clj for cider-tour project](images/project_clj.jpg)

The cider-tour project has dependency on Clojure 1.8.0. Like Maven and other build automation tools, Leiningen auto-downloads project dependencies.
