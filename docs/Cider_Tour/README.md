# A Quick Tour of Cider

## Setup

Before we get stared, make sure you have:

* Installed CIDER and it's prerequisites (see [Installation](../../Installation/README.md))
    
*  Configured your Leiningen install to use the CIDER REPL plugin (see [Configuration](../../Configuration/README.md))

* Cloned the [GitHub](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro) repository (see [Presentation Materials](../../Presentation_Materials/README.md))

## Notes

### Emacs Configuration

A minimal base Emacs init file ([init.el](../../../code/elisp/init_file/00_base/init.el)) was used for the exercises and screenshots in this chapter. In subsequent chapters we will progressively update the Emacs init file to enhance the CIDER development experience.

All of the versions of the Emacs config files used in this presentation are located within the GitHub project in the ```code/elisp/init_file``` directory. Each version of the ```init.el``` file is stored in a sub-directory that has a numeric prefix indicating the version ('00' being the initial version) and a short description. The sub-directory containing the version used in this chapter is ```00_base```.
