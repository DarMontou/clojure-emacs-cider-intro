# A Quick Tour of Cider

## Setup

Before we get stared, make sure you have:

* Installed CIDER and it's prerequisites (see [Installation](../../Installation/README.md))
    
*  Configured your Leiningen install to use the CIDER REPL plugin (see [Configuration](../../Configuration/README.md))

* Cloned the [GitHub](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro) repository (see [Presentation Materials](../../Presentation_Materials/README.md))

## Notes

### Emacs Configuration

A minimal Emacs init file ([init.el](https://github.com/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro/blob/master/code/elisp/init_file/00_base/init.el)) was used for the exercises and screenshots in this chapter. The init file contains the minimal configuration necessary to enable installation of Emacs packages (as discussed in [Installation](../../Installation/README.md)).

In subsequent chapters we will progressively update the Emacs init file to enhance the CIDER development experience. (see [Presentation Materials](../../Presentation_Materials/README.md) for details)
