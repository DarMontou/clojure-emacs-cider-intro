# Interactive Development

In the previous section we worked directly within the CIDER REPL buffer to run Clojure code. In addition to providing a dedicated REPL buffer, CIDER also provides integrated access to the REPL while working within buffers of Clojure source files. The integrated access enables a quick feedback loop where a developer can edit code, update the state and/or code of the running application in the REPL and observe the changes. 

The integrated access to the REPL is provided through the `cider-mode` minor that we discussed in [Cider Mode](../Cider_Mode/README.md).

In this section we will leverage the features of a running REPL while editing Clojure source files.
