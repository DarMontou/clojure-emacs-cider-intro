# Clojure Code Sample Project

This directory contains a [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) Clojure project with simple code examples to demonstrate the capabilities of [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider). These code examples are referenced in the documentation (located in the top-level ```"docs"``` directory) for the "Clojure Emacs Cider Intro" [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/tbellisiv/clojure-emacs-cider-intro).
